# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide encompassing HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript essentials. With the help and guidance of the Prework guide from instructors, I was able to structure the guide with clear explanations on these topics. This project was a valuable learning experience, which allowed me to begin my journey in the coding community by equipping myself with the foundational knowledge necessary for a successful start in web development

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

Each section offers comprehensive notes on essential topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, providing a structured foundation for learning. Also, the guide incorporates interactive elements, such as JavaScript functions examples that can be observed in action through the DevTools console.
